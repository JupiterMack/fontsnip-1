"""
The GUI Package for FontSnip.

This package contains all user interface components for the FontSnip application,
built using the PyQt6 framework. It includes widgets for screen capture,
result display, and system tray integration.

By importing the primary GUI classes here, we provide a simplified and
centralized access point for other parts of the application, such as the main
app controller.
"""

# The following imports are placeholders for the actual GUI component classes
# that will be defined in their respective modules within this package.
# Uncommenting them allows for cleaner imports from other parts of the application,
# e.g., `from fontsnip.gui import CaptureOverlay`.

# from .capture_overlay import CaptureOverlay
# from .results_window import ResultsWindow

# Define the public API of the gui package.
# When a module does `from fontsnip.gui import *`, only these names will be imported.
# __all__ = [
#     "CaptureOverlay",
#     "ResultsWindow",
# ]
